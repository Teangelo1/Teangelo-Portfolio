#Portfolio becomes Responsive!

Goal: Update Portfolio Page

## Developer: Teangelo Burks

**Tips for making my Portfolio Responsive:**
* When viewing my site on an xs screen my content takes up the entire page.
&nbsp;
* When viewing my site on a sm or larger screen, You'll notice that my content does not take up the entire screen. The reason for this is due to bootstrap's grid layout system using containers, rows, and columns.
&nbsp;

* While bootstrap does have an amazing grid layout system, Our good friend CSS comes in handy with adding padding/margins to help with getting our content properly aligned.
&nbsp;

*  Responsive Navigation Bar with all functioning links(Home, Portfolio, and Contact Page).
